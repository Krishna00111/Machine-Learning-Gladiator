# 8 Fun Machine Learning Projects for Beginners

In this guide, we’ll be walking through 8 fun machine learning projects for beginners.

No amount of theory can replace hands-on practice. 

Projects help you improve your applied ML skills quickly while giving you the chance to explore an interesting topic.

Plus, you can add projects into your portfolio, making it easier to land a job, find cool career opportunities, and even negotiate a higher salary.

This guide is an implementation for projects that had mentioned [here](https://elitedatascience.com/machine-learning-projects-for-beginners).

## 1. Machine Learning Gladiator
The goal is to take **out-of-the-box** models and apply them to different datasets.
- First, you’ll build intuition for model-to-problem fit. Which models are robust to missing data? Which models handle categorical features well?
- Second, this project will teach you the invaluable skill of prototyping models quickly.
- Finally, this exercise helps you master the workflow of model building. For example, you’ll get to practice…
   - Importing data
   - Cleaning data
   - Splitting it into train/test or cross-validation sets
   - Pre-processing
   - Transformations
   - Feature engineering
   - Saving model for future use using `joblib`

### Tutorial
You can go through this tutorial along side *my implementation* in **jupyter notebooks**.
- [An introduction to machine learning with scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/) – Official tutorial for the sklearn package.

### Data Sources
To practice and explore different types od data
  - [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/) – 350+ searchable datasets spanning almost every subject matter. You’ll definitely find datasets that interest you.
  - [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) – 100+ datasets uploaded by the Kaggle community. There are some really fun datasets here, including PokemonGo spawn locations and Burritos in San Diego.
  - [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/) – Open datasets released by the U.S. government. Great place to look if you’re interested in social sciences.
